# SPM pump cleaning script
#
# Version: 0.1
# Author: Dimitrios Simatos
# Last updated: 2022-09-05
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Description
#
# This script is designed to run the cleaning sequence of the SPM OEM pump.
# This script needs to be run 4 times!
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Changes
#
# Placed initialization and hard stop commands in the beginning.
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Important points
#
# Never leave any liquid in the pump to dry after the experiments. If they dry, the residue may block the valve.
# Always run the cleaning cycle after the experiments.
# Use clockwise rotation when going up in valve port numbers and vice versa.
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Things to do before running the script
#
# Set time units to seconds.
# Remove all reservoirs, except the one in Port 3.
# Set filenames.
# Replace the tubing, if necessary.
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Port connections
#
# Port 1: Waste
# Port 2: Waste
# Port 3: Various cleaning liquids
# Port 4: Waste
# Port 5: Waste
# Port 6: Waste
#
# Between each of the 4 runs, the settings of Port 3 will change, according to the cleaning protocol.
# The settings for Port 3 are:
# 1st run: 1% v/v solution of sodium hypochlorite in ultrapure water
# 2nd run: 0.1% w/v solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate in ultrapure water
# 3rd run: Ultrapure water
# 4th run: Air (not immersed in liquid)
#
# Alternatively:
# 1st run: 5x wash with DI water
# 2nd run: 10x alternative washing with DI water and EtOH
# 3rd run: 5x wash with DI water
#
# NOTE: Ethanol gets absorbed by the non HPLC-grade PTFE membrane, unless it is washed away immediately.
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Cleaning protocol for the SPM OEM pump (from the manual)
#
# A cleaning procedure should be performed at the end of each day or in between two different experiments.
# An effective cleaning can be performed in the following manner:
# • Bleach solution to kill microorganisms
# 1. Prepare a solution of 1% chlorine bleach and deionized water
#    NOTE: Prepare a 1% v/v solution of sodium hypochlorite in deionized water
# 2. Prepare a reservoir and place 1 tubing in the bleach solution and 5 tubings in a waste recipient
# 3. Pick up the bleach solution through 1 port to entirely fill the syringe
# 4. Sequentially output the syringe content through the remaining ports and throw it to the waste
# 5. Repeat operation at least 2 times
# • Detergent solution to remove debris
# 1. Prepare a solution of 0.1% detergent and deionized water
#    NOTE: Prepare a 0.1% w/v solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate in deionized water
# 2. Move the tubing from the bleach solution reservoir and place it into a reservoir of detergent solution
# 3. Pick up the detergent solution through 1 port to entirely fill the syringe
# 4. Sequentially output the detergent solution through the remaining ports into the waste recipient
# 5. Repeat operation at least 2 times
# • Rinsing water to prepare the pump for your next experiment
# 1. Move the tubing from the detergent solution reservoir and place it into a reservoir of deionized water
# 2. Pick up the rinsing solution through 1 port to entirely fill the syringe
# 3. Sequentially output the rinse water through the remaining ports into the waste recipient
# 4. Repeat operation at least 2 times
# • Replace the tubing, if necessary
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Cleaning protocol from the Knowles Group
# 5x wash with DI water
# 10x alternative washing with DI water and EtOH
# 5x wash with DI water
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Pumping cycles and execution time
#
# Execution time for a single cycle: 7 x 10 sec = 70 seconds
# Total execution time: 5 x 70 = 350 seconds
# Since the script has to run 4 times, the cleaning lasts for: 4 x 350 = 1400 seconds = 23.33 minutes
# Air must be the last to be pumped through the valve, to remove all liquids.
# There are 5 pumping cycles. Each one draws a different liquid through port 3 and pumps it sequentially through ports 1,2,4,5,6.
# During the sequential pumping, each port receives 1 ml of liquid (100% of the total syringe volume = 3000 "plunger units")
# The device must be disconnected from the port during the cleaning procedure.
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Volume of liquid needed
#
# Volume of liquid needed per cycle: 1 ml
# Total volume of liquid needed per script run: 5 x 1 = 5 ml
# Since the script has to run 4 times, the first 3 with different liquids, I need:
# 5 ml of 1% v/v solution of sodium hypochlorite in ultrapure water
# 5 ml of 0.1% w/v solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate in ultrapure water
# 5 ml of ultrapure water
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Parameters
#
# Syringe size: 1 ml
# Step resolution: N = 0.01 mm
# Drawing flow: V = 300 pulses/second (6000 ul/min)
# Pumping flow: V = 300 pulses/second (6000 ul/min)
